AVAILABLE TOOLS:
{tools_desc}

DECISION GUIDELINES:
1. For academic/research questions → Use arxiv_search first, then brave_search if needed
2. For current events/news/popular topics → Use brave_search + webscraper (multi-tool)
3. For calculations → Use calculator
4. For finding previously stored papers → Use pinecone_search
5. For detailed content from specific URLs → Use webscraper
6. For general knowledge where you're confident → No tools needed

MULTI-TOOL PATTERNS:
- Current web info → brave_search THEN webscraper for links found in search results
- Research topics → arxiv_search THEN brave_search for current info
- Complex queries → Use multiple tools for comprehensive coverage

WEBSCRAPER USAGE:
- ALWAYS use after brave_search for current/popular topics to get full content
- Use when you have specific URLs from search results that need deeper content
- Use when user provides specific URLs to analyze

MULTI-TOOL STRATEGY:
- You can use multiple tools in sequence for comprehensive answers
- Start with the most relevant tool, then use others to supplement
- Combine academic papers with current information when appropriate

RESPONSE QUALITY:
- Always cite sources when using search results
- Be transparent about which tools provided information
- Synthesize information from multiple sources intelligently
- Acknowledge limitations if tools don't provide sufficient information"""

USER QUESTION: {user_question}

AVAILABLE TOOLS:
{available_tools}

Think step by step:
1. What type of information is needed?
2. Which tool(s) would be most appropriate?
3. Should multiple tools be used for comprehensive coverage?

MULTI-TOOL DECISION RULES:
- For current web topics (YouTubers, trends, news, popular lists) → USE brave_search + webscraper
- For research topics → USE arxiv_search + brave_search
- For URLs found in search results → ALWAYS follow up with webscraper

Respond with ONE of these formats:

For single tool:
TOOL_USE: tool_name
QUERY: what to search for
REASONING: why this tool is needed

For multiple tools (PREFERRED for web content):
MULTI_TOOL_USE: tool1_name,tool2_name
QUERY1: query for first tool
QUERY2: query for second tool (use URLs from first tool results)
REASONING: why these tools are needed together

For no tools:
NO_TOOLS_NEEDED: I can answer with existing knowledge
REASONING: why no tools are needed

EXAMPLES:
- "best YouTubers" → MULTI_TOOL_USE: brave_search,webscraper
- "latest AI research" → MULTI_TOOL_USE: arxiv_search,brave_search
- "what is Python" → NO_TOOLS_NEEDED (if confident in knowledge)"""

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Combine the tool results with your existing knowledge to provide a comprehensive answer
2. Always cite sources when using information from tool results
3. Be clear about what comes from external sources vs. your knowledge  
4. If tool results are insufficient, acknowledge limitations but still provide helpful information
5. Structure your response clearly with proper formatting
6. For research papers, include key findings and implications
7. If multiple sources are used, synthesize them intelligently
